# Exoplanets_Nasa_Project

### 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge 

### Team: 6alma_sok
  
### The challenge: Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration  


## This repo contains:
- A game in Godot,
  in which you can navigate a spaceship to
  4 exoplanets and a Star!
  It is an Exoplanet viewer game, where
  you can use a spaceship to navigate on the map.
  We believe that visualizing exoplanets will make the
  learning experience much more exciting for
  students interested in this subject.

- Additionally, we wanted to make this project more memorable
  by making a quiz in NetBeans and
  Java Swing, using Java as the programming language.
