# Exoplanets_Nasa_Project

### 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge 

### Team: 6alma_sok
  
### The challenge: Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration  


## This repo contains:
- A game in Godot,
  in which you can navigate a space ship to
  4 exoplanets and a Star!
  It is an Exoplanet viewer game, where
  you can use a spaceship to navigate on the map.
  We thought that by visualizing exoplanets,
  will make it much more exciting for students who
  wish to learn about this subject.

- Also, we wanted to make this project a little bit more
  unforgettable by making a quiz in NetBeans and
  Java Swing, using Java as the programming language.
